To enable data analytics in a business, it is important to understand the organisations objectives and key decisions they aim to drive with the data. This ensures that the  analytics framework aligns with the business needs and provides usable insights.

By working backward from the business's objectives and decisions, we ensure that the analytics solution is not just about gathering and storing data but about empowering decision-makers with actionable insights that directly impact business performance.

### 1) Understand Business Goals and Objectives (From start to end)
 - **Meet with the business stakeholders:** Meeting with key decision makers (executives, department heads, etc) to understand the companies strategic goals
 - **Identify key business questions:** Ask the stakeholders what problems they are trying to solve or what decisions they need to make. This could improving operational efficiency, enhancing customer experiences, identifying new revenue streams etc.
 - **Translate goals into measurable metrics:** Once you understand high-end goals, break them down into KPI's/metrics the business wants to track. 
 - **Examples:**
	 - **Business Goals:** Improve customer retention, Improve customer relationships, Identify revenue stream profitability.
	 - **KPIs:** Customer churn rate, Net Promoter Score, repeat purchase rate.
### 2) Identify Key Data Sources

- **Explore Existing Data: **Understand what the company is already collecting and how it stored. (CRM's, ERP's, transactional databases, external data)
- **Gap Analysis:** Identify if there are gaps in data collection relative to business goals and KPIs. What is missing? What do we need to collect in the future?
- **Evaluate Data Quality:** Determine if data is accurate, complete and clean enough for analysis. Poor data quality can lead to invalid insights.

### 3)  Stakeholder [[Requirements Gathering]]
- **Conduct Stakeholder Meetings/Interviews/Workshops:** Meet with different departments (e.g. marketing, finance, operations) to understand their specific needs and how they plan on using the data.
- **Define Use Cases:** Develop specific use cases for how each department would use the analytics framework to drive their decisions.
	- **Examples:** 
		- Sales want to track their sales pipeline velocity
		- Marketing want to analyse campaign performance
- **Document Requirements:** Record the various metrics, dashboards, reports and visualisations stakeholders needs and the delivery objective requirements. (Daily, Monthly, Quarterly)
- ![[Requirements Gathering]]

### 4) [[Data Governance and Compliance]]
- **Define data governance policies:** Establish who owns the data and who is responsible for maintaining it. Set clear roles for data stewardship.
- **Security and privacy:** Ensure data compliance with regulatory requirements (e.g. [[GDPR]], [[HIPAA]]), especially if personal or sensitive data is involved.
- **Access control:** Determine who needs access to what data. Ensure that there are controls in place for data security and privacy.

### 5) Design the Analytics Infrastructure
- **Choose the right tool and platforms:** Based on the requirements, selct the appropriate tools for data collection, storage and analysis. (Cloud data warehouses, data lakes, business intelligence tools).
- **Data integration:** Plan how data will flow from different sources into the central analytics platform. This might involve [[ETL]] processes or data streaming.

### 6) Develop Reporting and Visualisation
- **Dashboard creation:** Build dashboards that provide at-a-glance insights into key business metrics for decision-makers.
- **Self-service analytics:** Enable business users to access and alayse data on their own by providing user-friendly tools and training.
- **Tailor outputs for stakeholders:** Ensure that reports or dashboards are tailored for each stakeholder's needs. Executives may want high-level summaries, while analysts might need more detailed data.

### 7) Test, Iterate and Validate
- **Pilot test the system:** Run a pilot with a small set of stakeholders to ensure the analytics meet their expectations and that the data is accurate.
- **Validate insights** Make sure that the data-driven insights align with real-world outcomes and business processes.
- **Iterate based on feedback:** Refine the data models, reports and dashboards based on stakeholder feedback.

### 8) Establish a Feedback Loop for Continuous Improvement
- **Ongoing communication:** Regularly meet with stakeholders to ensure their data needs are being met and make adjustments as business goals evolve.
- **Track analytics adoption:** Measure how well the analytics solution is being used and whether it is driving decisions. If not, figure out why and iterate accordingly.
